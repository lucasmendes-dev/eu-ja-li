# Eu JÃ¡ Li

Project designed for users to register the books they have read, the ones they have stopped reading or the ones they want to read in the future.

Developed mainly to have greater clarity about what has been read during each user's life, providing insights into which topic was read the most, which year the most books were read and which books the user will still read.
